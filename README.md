## **Description**

In this paper we process and analyze data concerning Hepatitis. The data was taken from the UCI and analyzed with the help of the Python language.In order to process them corectly,we use methods such as feature selection, oversampling and categorization models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. To evaluate their performance we use cross validation and after comparing the results, we can see which method performs best for this particular dataset .
